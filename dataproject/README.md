# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data Project on the Distribution and Specification of Births in Denmark** and is about 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. DK_AdministrativeUnits.gml (https://dataforsyningen.dk/data/992) 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

1. Run `conda install geopandas` in Anaconda Terminal Prompt if on windows or Terminal if on Mac.
2. Install `dstapi` with `%pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi` in notebook
3. Install `pandas-datareader` with `%pip install pandas-datareader` in notebook

The above dstapi and pandas-datareader have lines in the start of the notebook `dataproject.ipynb` that can be uncommented to install. Geopandas is recommended to install with conda so dependencies also are installed. For more information on downloading geopandas see https://geopandas.org/en/stable/.
